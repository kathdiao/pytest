# Pytest Learning Project

This repository contains my practice code for learning **Pytest** and improving my understanding of unit testing in Python.  
**This project is for learning purposes only.**

The code includes simple functions and test cases that help me explore:
- basic assertions  
- test structure and organization
- understanding test failures  
- experimenting with Pytest behavior  

Some files contain **Taglish comments** because I use them as personal notes while studying.
